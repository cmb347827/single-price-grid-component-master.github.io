## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- I'm more comfortable using Sass color functions in combination with Sass color maps.

- Why to use `overflow: hidden;` for a container to be able to show the border-radius.

### Continued development
